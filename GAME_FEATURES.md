# Game Features

This document should include descriptions of all planned and current game features.

------------------

## Villager Management

Each player should supervise up to *X* villagers. They should be exclusively responsible for them, but should not control them directly. All villagers should have a list of priorities itemizing both their individual needs and their assigned tasks. This list should be editable by the respective player.

#### **Needs**

* Villagers should need to sleep, drink and eat.
* Illness and the cold could represent additional issues, but the focus should not be on survival.

#### **Professions**

* 

------------------

## Village Growth

As the village's population grows, so should the village itself, expanding in size and opportunities for its citizens.

#### **Building Construction**

* The construction of a building should take time and resources.
* The player's task should be to lay the foundation with a blueprint of their choosing and to ensure the required resources will be provided. For this, the player should assign professions to his villagers to either mine the appropriate resources or to use these resources in the building's construction.

#### **Unlocking Technologies/Concepts**

* When a new type of building has been built, it should unlock new types of buildings or enable the player's villagers to perform new tasks.
* It could also boost the villagers' performance in some tasks.
